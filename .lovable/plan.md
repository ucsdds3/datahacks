# DataHacks 2026 Website Plan

## 🎨 Design Concept: "Dive Into Data"
An immersive ocean-themed experience that starts at a sunny beach and transitions deeper underwater as visitors scroll. The color palette will feature vibrant summer vibes with **sandy yellows, ocean blues, seafoam greens**, and tech-inspired accents like subtle neon glows for that data science feel.
